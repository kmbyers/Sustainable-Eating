      <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
      <h5>A short explaination of the project.</h5>
      <p>For the research component of this project, I am looking at sustainable eating. Within this broad topic, I am specifically looking at what is entailed in sustainable eating and the issues with providing sustainable methods for food and food production to consumers. Within my research, I found that sustainable eating is an important and necessary idea both for environmental purposes and human health. I also discovered that the major issues with sustainable eating stem from a lack of motivation or desire to eat sustainably, lack of education in regards to sustainable eating practices, lack of access to sustainable foods, and practicality of implementing sustainable eating practices such as feeding large populations or being cost efficient. After doing this preliminary research, I interviewed two people who are involved in sustainable eating practices here in Raleigh, one at a business level and one at a local farm level. </p>
      <p>I spoke first to the cofounder of Happy + Hale, a local restaurant here in Raleigh, Tyler Helikson. Tyler spoke of the importance of sustainability, but mentioned difficulties in providing sustainable food from a company and business standpoint. Some of these issues included availability, access, costs, and amounts of food required for production. I then spoke to Kay Coleman, the urban agriculture manager for the Interfaith Food Shuttle at the Camden Street Garden here in Raleigh. Kay also spoke of the importance of sustainability, especially for people located in areas that are defined as ‘food deserts’. However, Kay also mentioned issues providing sustainable foods from a local and individual perspective. Some of these issues included access, availability, and education. After speaking to both Tyler and Kay, it was evident that sustainable eating is of great importance for the community and our planet, however there are many issues in providing sustainable foods. Therefore for this design problem, I am looking at how to bridge the gap of providing sustainable foods to consumers, how to encourage consumers to eat more sustainably, and the various drivers of this gap that can be improved. .</p>

      <h3>WAYS TO PRACTICE</h3>
      <h5> Here are some ways that you can practice on an individual level! <h5> 
     <img src= Images/WaystoPractice.jpg alt="WaystoPractice" style="width:100%">
          
        <p> In practicing or moving towards sustainable eating, there are multiple approaches to maintaining a more sustainable and environmentally friendly diet. On an individual and local level of practicing sustainable eating, one can take actions such as prioritizing vegetables, minimizing meat intake (specifically red meats as those are more degrading to the environment to produce), selecting seafood wisely (for example choose fish species that are not being overfished), shopping for foods locally (shopping at the local farmers market), and eat mindfully. Take the time to think about where the food is coming from, how it is impacting and affecting the body, and pay attention to how much food one really needs . Even just paying more attention to food consumption and thinking about the environmental impacts can assist in reducing the environmental degradation caused by food production. <p>
